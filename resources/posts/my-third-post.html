    the past 20 days, the lives of Palestinians living outside Gaza and the West Bank have been drastically warped by non-stop feelings of worry and panic over their loved ones still in Gaza.
    Sporadic, limited exchanges on WhatsApp have brought occasional moments of respite.
    However, any extended gap in communication has been met with paralysing anxiety - marked by questions like: "Are they dead, are they alive, was their house bombed too?"
    Now, with internet and telecommunications lines cut off in Gaza, panic for the relatives of the roughly 2.3 million people living there is at an all-time high.
    In a WhatsApp, but not knowing if they'll ever hear from their loved ones in Gaza again.
